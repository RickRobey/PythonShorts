webcam.py Readme
==================
This program will access your laptop webcam (hopefully!) so you can check your appearance
before jumping onto Zoom for that important interview.

I suggest you put the downloaded file into your home directory. Open a terminal and issue the 
following command:

chmod +x webcam.py

You should be able to run the program by using the terminal and typing:

webcam.py

Press 'q' to close the webcam.
